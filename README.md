## ðŸ˜Ž Reflection

Everlush ERP is a side project I am building to help small businesses keep records of the business activities. Current project goals include using technologies learned to bootstrap the project and create an MVP.

Originally I wanted to build an ERP application for my mum's SME business called Everlush Limited. I started this process by creating the database models using MongooseJs and the MongoDB CLI, then creating routes with ExpressJS to access seeded data, and adding Bootstrap classes to EJS templates for basic styling.

The technologies I currently use in this project are `EJS`, `Bootstrap`, `NodeJs`, `ExpressJS`, `MongoDB`, and React. I chose to use the EJS layout to minimize effort while setting up APIs initial setup and invest more time diving into the technical parts. After my initial commit to GitHub, I deployed the project on Heroku due to its ease of setup.

In the next iterations, I plan on creating the other important routes, adding authentication, handling errors and eventually using React to improve the UI.
